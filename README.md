# vehicle_counter_ssd

As pedestrians taking the dog for a walk, escorting our kids to school, or marching to our workplace in the morning, we’ve all experienced unsafe, fast-moving vehicles operated by inattentive drivers that nearly mow us down.

Many of us live in apartment complexes or housing neighborhoods where ignorant drivers disregard safety and zoom by, going way too fast.

We feel almost powerless. These drivers disregard speed limits, crosswalk areas, school zones, and “children at play” signs altogether. When there is a speed bump, they speed up almost as if they are trying to catch some air!

Is there anything we can do?

In most cases, the answer is unfortunately “no” — we have to look out for ourselves and our families by being careful as we walk in the neighborhoods we live in.

But what if we could catch these reckless neighborhood miscreants in action and provide video evidence of the vehicle, speed, and time of day to local authorities?

"Vechicle Detection, Tracking and Counting" using TensorFlow Object Counting API

The TensorFlow Object Counting API is used as a base for object counting on this project

Vehicle counting and classification can give accurate information about the vehicle density on a particular city road or highway which helps in advanced traffic monitoring and management.

we’ll design our computer vision system to collect timestamps of cars to measure speed.
Our system relies on a combination of object detection and object tracking to find cars in a video stream at different waypoints.
